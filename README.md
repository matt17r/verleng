# Verleng

Data quality dashboards and integration toolkit for K-12 schools.

## About

This is the open source repository for Verleng. If you want to install and manage Verleng yourself (or contribute to its development) you're in the right place.

If you just want to try it out, head to [Verleng](https://verleng.com) and add yourself to the contact list to stay up to date with developments on Verleng hosted.

## Development

See `Gemfile` (in the root of this repository) for the version of Ruby and Rails Verleng uses. Once you have any prerequisites installed run `bin/setup`.

To start the app, run `bin/dev`. This will use Foreman to start up the services specified in `Procfile.dev`.

Once it starts up, access the service locally on http://localhost:3000.
